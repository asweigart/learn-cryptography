Wired article about historians working with geeks to uncover a secret society.

Idea:
 - Start story - you are a historian who has uncovered a document - but it's encrypted!
 - The document *is* this actual document
 - End story explains that this is a real cipher (can't explain in the begining because then you could just look it up)
